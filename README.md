ExtraBackends
=============

This project provides additional backends to be used with PermissionsEx. The backends in this project, while well-tested and potentially useful, do not meet the requirements to be included with PEX (by being read-only, or high-maintenance, or less-used than the core backends). These backends are provided as a separate package to be available to users in case of usefulness.
